                <h3>Lung Tumor Segmentation using U-Net (Dec 2024 - Present)</h3>
                <p>
                    Implementing a PyTorch-based U-Net for automated lung tumor segmentation in CT scans. 
                    Built a robust pre-processing pipeline (normalization, data augmentation, oversampling) 
                    to address variability and class imbalance in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset.

                <h3>Enhancing NYC Subway Announcements Using Audio Signal Processing (Sep - Nov 2024)</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed and implemented a noise-reduction system for NYC subway announcements using high-pass 
                    Butterworth and Wiener filtering techniques, validated through spectrogram analysis on real-world 
                    audio samples. Explored source separation, ICA, and dereverberation to enhance speech quality in 
                    noisy environments.

                <h3>Eliminating Child Care Deserts in New York State through Optimization (Sep - Nov 2024)</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a linear integer optimization model using Gurobi, to address childcare deserts in New York by
                    optimizing facility expansions and resource allocation under budget constraints, achieving a minimum
                    feasible funding estimate of ~$350 million. Implemented fairness constraints and distance-based optimization to ensure equitable childcare access
                    across regions to balance cost, coverage, and demographic requirements.

                <h3>Mathematical Modeling of Carbon-Cycle in Nature (Sep - Nov 2024)</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented a mathematical model of the carbon cycle using Python-based ODE solvers, reproducing
                    Eriksson and Welander’s results to analyze carbon exchange dynamics among the atmosphere, ocean,
                    and biosphere. Investigated system stability and oscillations through eigenvalue analysis of the linearized model, verifying
                    equilibrium points and exploring the impact of time lags and fossil carbon consumption rates.

            <article>
                <h3>Design of a Metamaterial Radar Absorber (Aug - Dec 2020)</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed a novel radar absorber with a low profile of 0.0739 wavelengths at its lowest operating frequency
                    and a strong fractional bandwidth of 100.55 % from 3.13 to 9.46 GHz.
                    Presented research findings at the 2021 National Conference on Communications held at IIT Kanpur.
